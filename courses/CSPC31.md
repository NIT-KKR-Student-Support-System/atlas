# Outcomes

- Compare, contrast, and apply the key algorithmic design paradigms: brute force, divide and conquer, decrease and conquer, transform and conquer, greedy, dynamic.
- Compare, contrast, and apply key data structures: trees, lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and graph representations.
- Compare, contrast, and apply algorithmic tradeoffs: time vs. space, deterministic vs. randomized, and exact vs. approximate.
- Implement, empirically compare, and apply fundamental algorithms and data structures to real-world problems.
