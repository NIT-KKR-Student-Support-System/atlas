          A doctor checked 1000 patients, out of which he diagnosed 400 as
          `Diabetic` and 600 as `non-Diabetic`. Out of 400, 370 were actually
          diabetic. Similarly out of 600, 560 were actually non-diabetic. Using
          a confusion matrix, compute the following:

            1. A person is actually non-diabetic, what is the probability that
               the doctor diagnosed him correctly?
            2. The doctor has diagnosed a person as `Diabetic`. What is the
               probability that he diagnosed it correctly?
            3. What is the probability that the doctor classified an actual
               diabetic person as `Diabetic`?
