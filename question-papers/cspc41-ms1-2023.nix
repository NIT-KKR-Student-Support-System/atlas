          A random sample of 400 families of KKR is found to have an average
          income of ₹3025. Assume that the population standard deviation is
          ₹280. An agency claims that the average monthly income of families of
          KKR is greater than ₹3000. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test at
          95% confidence interval to check the validity of the agency. Design
          both hypotheses. Mention which test is applied and then compute the
          validity.
