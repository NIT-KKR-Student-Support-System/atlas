            A digital common bus system for 16 registers of 32 bits each. The
            bus is constructed with multiplexers.
              1. How many selection inputs are there in each multiplexer?
              2. What size of multiplexers are needed?
              3. How many multiplexers are there in the bus?

            Simplify the following Boolean function in sum-of-products form by
            means of a four-variable map. Draw the logic diagram with:
              1. AND-OR gate
              2. NAND gates
