          Consider the set of 5 processes whose arrival time and burst time are
          given below:

            <br />

            | Process | Burst Time | Arrival Time |
            |---------|------------|--------------|
            | P1      | 3          | 0            |
            | P2      | 6          | 2            |
            | P3      | 4          | 4            |
            | P4      | 5          | 6            |
            | P5      | 2          | 8            |

          If the CPU scheduling policy is Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF),
          find the average waiting time, average turn-around time, and
          throughput with the help of a Gantt chart.
