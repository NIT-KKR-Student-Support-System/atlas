          Design a circular water tank resting on the ground, having a capacity
          of 2,00,000 litres of water using approximate method. Assume concrete
          of grade M25 and steel of Fe500.

          A concrete beam of dimensions 100mm×300mm is pre-tensioned with 5
          straight wires of 7mm diameter over its complete length of 6m. An
          anchorage slip of 5mm is observed. The average prestress after
          short-term losses is 0.7fpk = 1200N/mm<sup>2</sup> and the age of
          loading is given as 28 days. Given that E<sub>p</sub> = 200 ×
          10<sup>3</sup> MPa, E<sub>c</sub> = 35000 MPa, relative humidity as
          80%. Determine the losses of prestress. Neglect the weight of the beam
          in the computation of the stresses.
