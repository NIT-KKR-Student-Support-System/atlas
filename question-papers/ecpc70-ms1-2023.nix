          A two-cavity amplifier klystron has the following parameters:
            - V<sub>0</sub> = 900V, I<sub>0</sub> = 30mA, f = 8GHz
            - Gap spacing in either cavitiy: d = 1mm
            - Spacing between centers of cavities: L = 4cm
            - Effective shunt impedance: R<sub>sh</sub> = 40kΩ

          Given X = 1.841, J<sub>1</sub>(X) = 0.582, and R<sub>0</sub> =
          V<sub>0</sub>/I<sub>0</sub>, determine:
            1. The electron velocity
            2. The dc electron transit time
            3. The input voltage for maximum output voltage
            4. The voltage gain in decibels
            5. Efficiency of the amplifier

          A travelling-wave cube (TWT) operates under the following parameters:
            - V<sub>0</sub> = 3kV, I<sub>0</sub> = 30mA, f = 10GHz
            - Characteristic impedance of helix: Z<sub>0</sub> = 10Ω
            - Circuit length: N = 50
